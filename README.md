# CryptoClustering
Module 11 Challenge

Date: 8/5/2024

Brief Description: For this challenge, I used the KMeans algorithm and PCA method to classify cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages accross various different timeframes (24h, 7d, 30d, 60d, 200d, 1y). I found the best value for k (number of clusters) for both models (original scaled data and PCA data), visualized the clusters, found the total explained variance of the three principal components, and determined which features had the strongest positive and negative influence on each of the PCA's.
